# Gabriel de Freitas 😁

✋ Hi! I'm a Software Engineer with front-end development as major knowledge.

🖥️ I have built enterprise and consumer products with web technologies around the universes of React/Angular on front-end development and Java/JavaScript on the backend development, within cloud environments like AWS and other cloud services. I also developed and maintained libraries and worked on research projects.

🎯 I like any kind of technology, my passion is totally related to improving people's lives!

*... discipline, persistence and commitment.* 🚀
