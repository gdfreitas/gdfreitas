☕🚴‍♂️ Hey! I am Gabriel Freitas, born in 96, and been in contact with Web Technologies since 2013, where I found myself improving open source games that I used to play along with my friends.

🖥️ I'm currently working as Software Architect at Betha Sistemas. My team is responsible for the design and evolution of a cloud Platform which supports the whole company's products ecosystem and also 3rd party partners softwares for public administration in Brazil. In the past, I also worked in the same company building and maintaining in-house softwares, mainly our CRM.

⚙️📱 I really like both software and hardware, as I already worked as Eletronics Technician in a local company, doing some industrial automation.

🎯 Nowadays, I'm focusing my skills and learnings around the Frontend ecosystem, despite that I really like any kind of technology, then you'll probably see lots of things unrealated to Frontend in my stuff, like Backend, DevOps, Quality, Data Science, etc.

  *... discipline, persistence and commitment.* 🚀
