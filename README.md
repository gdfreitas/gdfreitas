# Gabriel de Freitas 😁

✋ Hi! I'm a software engineer at [Serasa](https://www.serasa.com.br). I am currently working as a software engineer specializing in front-end. Providing support between two large teams of the company's biggest consumer-oriented product, which is a platform called Limpa Nome, where consumers are able to negotiate debts with creditors.

🖥️ In the past I've used to work at [Betha Sistemas](http://betha.com.br/) in a team responsible for the design and evolution of a platform for the company's entire product ecosystem and also partners targeting public administration in Brazil. I also worked on building and maintaining in-house applications.

🎯 I like any kind of technology, my passion is totally related to improving people's lives!

  *... discipline, persistence and commitment.* 🚀
