✋ Hi! I'm a software engineer at [Serasa Experian](https://www.serasa.com.br)

🖥️ I used to work at [Betha Sistemas](http://betha.com.br/) in a team responsible for the design and evolution of a platform for the company's entire product ecosystem and also partners targeting public administration in Brazil. In the past, I also worked on building and maintaining in-house applications, especially our CRM.

🎯 I like any kind of technology, my passion is totally related to improving people's lives!

  *... discipline, persistence and commitment.* 🚀
